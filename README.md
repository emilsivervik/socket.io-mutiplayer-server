# socket.io-mutiplayer-server
This is a BASIC sample of how a multiplayer (on the srever-side) game could work, implemented with Client Side Prediction and Interpolation, the code is rewritten from Sven Bergstr√∂ms article: http://buildnewgames.com/real-time-multiplayer/

The reason I rewrote the code was because the code in his example was hard to understand (too messy) and I also wanted to clean it up using ES6 classes.

You can find the client-side code [HERE](https://github.com/emilsivervik/socket.io-mutiplayer-client)
